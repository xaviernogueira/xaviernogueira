- 👋 Hi, I’m @xaviernogueira
- 👀 I’m an environemntal scientist who has worked extensively with remote sensing and geospatial data from a variety of sources.
- 🌱 I currently am starting a role at LimnoTech, where I will be modeling water resources and contributing to applications that add value to our clients. Previously I developed a machine learning model to predict daily NO2 concentrations across continental USA. On the side, I am exploring finance, quantitative trading, and portfolio managment. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on remote sensing workflows and am hoping to work with developers creating automated climate change analytics software.
