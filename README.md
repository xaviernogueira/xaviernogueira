- 👋 Hi, I’m @xaviernogueira
- 👀 I’m an water resources scientist and developer who has worked extensively in both geospatial and data science contexts. 
- 🌱 I currently work for LimnoTech, where I have developed code for our clients across a range of contexts such as developing Machine Learning pipelines, conducting complex geospatial analyses, as well as more traditional backend web development using `Django`. On the side, I am exploring non-environmental data science applications such as automating financial analyses and portfolio managment decisions. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cloud-based remote sensing workflows (GEE) and "Smart Water AI" for real-time water resources infrastructure managment.
