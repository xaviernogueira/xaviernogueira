⛈ Hi, I’m Xavier Nogueira! I’m a data scientist/developer interested in adding value to the world at the nexus of technology and environmental science. I also dabble in quantitative finance. 

-----------------------
**My Public Projects**

🚀 [`Catalog-To-Xpublish`](https://github.com/LimnoTech/Catalog-To-Xpublish) - a server-side software designed to spin-up a [`fastapi`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/) API from an [`intake`](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/catalog.html) catalog or [STAC](https://stacspec.org/en). This allows all cataloged Zarr or NetCDF datasets to be served up efficiently, whether they're stored in the cloud or locally. What's more, the API can be easily extended with any of the growing number of [`xpublish`](https://github.com/xpublish-community/xpublish) plugins that are available.

🚀 [`Tabular_ML`](https://github.com/xaviernogueira/Tabular_ML) - A Python library containing some of my personal machine learning tools that I've packaged and open sourced. The library `tabular_ml` allows one to train, evaluate, ensemble, and optimize hyperparameters from a standardized interface. I implemented a "factory" design pattern to allow one to write simple plug-ins to include more models or alter behavior.

🚀 [`FCPGtools version 2.0`](https://github.com/usgs/water-fcpg-tools) - A ground-up refactor and redesign of [USGS's Flow-Conditioned Parameter Grid software](https://www.usgs.gov/software/flow-conditioned-parameter-grid-tools) implemented a `xarray` based workflow within a highly modular and extendable library architecture.  Compared to the previous version of the software, functionality has been vastly expanded, the need for saving local files has been eliminated, and processing speeds are nearly 10x faster. For more information, please reference our [documentation site](https://usgs.github.io/water-fcpg-tools/build/html/index.html).

🚀 [`Xarray-DataAccessor`](https://github.com/LimnoTech/Xarray-DataAccessor) - A Python library that faciliates rapid read-in of remote climate, topographic, land cover, and soils data into standardized `xarray.Dataset` objects. `Xarray-DataAccessor` includes a range of data transformations and utility functions that meet the needs of various hydrologic modelling requirements. The library is still a work in progress, and additional features are planned for future development.

⏳ `value_investing_tools` - A python toolset for the modern value investor! This is a pet project of mine that arose out of tools I've written for myself. *Release is expected in early 2023*.

🚀 [`GCS-Analysis-Tools`](https://github.com/xaviernogueira/GCS-Analysis-Tools) - A Graphic User Interface (GUI) enabling a complete Geomorphic Covariance Structure analysis (GCS). This project was a deliverable from time working as a graduate reasearch assistant for the [Pasternack Lab @ UC Davis](http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research) and has been used by others in the lab since my departure.
