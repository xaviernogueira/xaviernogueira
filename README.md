⛈ Hi, I’m Xavier Nogueira! I’m a data scientist/developer interested in adding value to the world at the nexus of technology and environmental science. I also dabble in quantitative finance.

**My Public Projects**

🚀 [`Catalog-To-Xpublish`](https://github.com/xpublish-experiments/Catalog-To-Xpublish) - a server-side software designed to spin up a [`fastapi`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/) API from an [`intake`](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/catalog.html) catalog or [STAC](https://stacspec.org/en). This allows all cataloged Zarr or NetCDF datasets to be served up efficiently, whether they're stored in the cloud or locally. What's more, the API can be easily extended with any of the growing numbers of [`xpublish`](https://github.com/xpublish-community/xpublish) plugins that are available.

🚀 [`xpublish-file-metadata`](https://github.com/xaviernogueira/xpublish-file-metadata) - a ["dataset router plugin"](https://xpublish.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.2/user-guide/plugins.html#dataset-router-plugins) for `xpublish` that allows underlying file (i.e., NetCDF, geoTIFF) metadata to be exposed/served.

🚀 [`Tabular_ML`](https://github.com/xaviernogueira/Tabular_ML) - A Python library containing some of my personal machine-learning tools that I've packaged and open sourced. The library `tabular_ml` allows one to train, evaluate, ensemble, and optimize hyperparameters from a standardized interface.

🚀 [`FCPGtools version 2.0`](https://github.com/usgs/water-fcpg-tools) - A ground-up refactor and redesign of [USGS's Flow-Conditioned Parameter Grid software](https://www.usgs.gov/software/flow-conditioned-parameter-grid-tools) implemented a `xarray` based workflow.  Compared to the previous version of the software, functionality has been vastly expanded, the need for saving local files has been eliminated, processing speeds are nearly 10x faster, and library architecture was modularized. For more information, please reference our [documentation site](https://usgs.github.io/water-fcpg-tools/build/html/index.html).

🚀 [`Xarray-DataAccessor`](https://github.com/LimnoTech/Xarray-DataAccessor) - A Python library that facilitates rapid read-in of remote climate, topographic, land cover, and soils data into standardized `xarray.Dataset` objects. `Xarray-DataAccessor` includes a range of data transformations and utility functions that meet various hydrologic modeling requirements. The library is still a work in progress, and additional features are planned for future development.

⏳ `value_investing_tools` - A Python toolset for the modern value investor! This is a pet project of mine that arose out of tools I've written for myself. *Release is expected in early 2023*.

🚀 [`GCS-Analysis-Tools`](https://github.com/xaviernogueira/GCS-Analysis-Tools) - A Graphic User Interface (GUI) enabling a complete Geomorphic Covariance Structure analysis (GCS). This project was a deliverable from time working as a graduate reasearch assistant for the [Pasternack Lab @ UC Davis](http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research) and has been used by others in the lab since my departure.
