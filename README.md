⛈ Hi, I’m Xavier Nogueira! I’m a data scientist/developer interested in adding value to the world at the nexus of technology and environmental science. I also dabble in quantitative finance. 

-----------------------
**My Public Projects**

⏳ [`Clearwater-modules`](https://github.com/EcohydrologyTeam/ClearWater-modules) - A `xarray` based implementation of water quality and vegetation process simulation modules being developed with the [U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC)](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil), [Environmental Laboratory (EL)](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Locations/EL/)

🚀 [`Catalog-To-Xpublish`](https://github.com/xpublish-experiments/Catalog-To-Xpublish) - spin up a [`fastapi`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/) API from an [`intake`](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/catalog.html) catalog or [STAC](https://stacspec.org/en). Efficiently serve up all cataloged Zarr or NetCDF datasets, whether they're stored in the cloud or locally, via [`xpublish`](https://github.com/xpublish-community/xpublish).

🚀 [`xpublish-file-metadata`](https://github.com/xaviernogueira/xpublish-file-metadata) - a ["dataset router plugin"](https://xpublish.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.2/user-guide/plugins.html#dataset-router-plugins) for `xpublish` that allows underlying file (i.e., NetCDF, GeoTIFF) metadata to be exposed/served.

🚀 [`Tabular_ML`](https://github.com/xaviernogueira/Tabular_ML) - A Python library containing some of my personal machine-learning tools that I've packaged and open sourced. The library `tabular_ml` allows one to train, evaluate, ensemble, and optimize hyperparameters from a standardized interface.

🚀 [`FCPGtools version 2.0`](https://github.com/usgs/water-fcpg-tools) - A ground-up refactor and redesign of [USGS's Flow-Conditioned Parameter Grid software](https://www.usgs.gov/software/flow-conditioned-parameter-grid-tools) implemented a `xarray` based workflow. For more information, please reference our [documentation site](https://usgs.github.io/water-fcpg-tools/build/html/index.html).

🚀 [`Xarray-DataAccessor`](https://github.com/LimnoTech/Xarray-DataAccessor) - Read-in gridded climate, topographic, land cover, and soils data into standardized `xarray.Dataset` objects. `Xarray-DataAccessor` includes a range of data transformations and utility functions that meet various hydrologic modeling requirements.

⏳ `value_investing_tools` - A Python toolset for the modern value investor! This is a pet project of mine that arose out of tools I've written for myself. *Release is expected in early 2023*.

🚀 [`GCS-Analysis-Tools`](https://github.com/xaviernogueira/GCS-Analysis-Tools) - A Graphic User Interface (GUI) enabling a complete Geomorphic Covariance Structure analysis (GCS). This project was a deliverable from time working as a graduate reasearch assistant for the [Pasternack Lab @ UC Davis](http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research)..
