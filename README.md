â›ˆ Hi, Iâ€™m Xavier Nogueira! Iâ€™m a data scientist / engineer passionate about advancing the world of geospatial data, especially as it relates to the Earth sciences. I also dabble in quantitative finance.

# My Public Projects
| Project                  | Role   | Organization | Description          
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------| ------------------------------------------
| [Catalog-to-Xpublish] | author | @LimnoTech | Spin up a [`fastapi`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/) API from an [`intake`](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/catalog.html) catalog or [STAC](https://stacspec.org/en). Efficiently serve up all cataloged Zarr or NetCDF datasets, whether they're stored in the cloud or locally, via [`xpublish`](https://github.com/xpublish-community/xpublish).
| [geoparquet-pydantic] | author | N/A | Validate and convert GeoJSON<>GeoParquet...without GDAL!
| [Clearwater-modules] | lead/contributor | @LimnoTech | A `xarray` based implementation of water quality and vegetation process simulation modules.
| [xpublish-file-metadata] | author | @xpublish-community | a ["dataset router plugin"](https://xpublish.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.2/user-guide/plugins.html#dataset-router-plugins) for `xpublish` that allows underlying file (i.e., NetCDF, GeoTIFF) metadata to be exposed/served.
| [xpublish-opendap] and [xpublish] | contributor | @xpublish-community | Core maintainer. Helping keep the libaries up-to-date and useful.
| [Tabular-ML] | author | N/A | A Python library containing some of my personal machine-learning tools that I've packaged and open sourced. Train, evaluate, ensemble, and optimize hyperparameters from a standardized interface.
| [FCPGtools v2] | author | @LimnoTech | A ground-up refactor and redesign of [USGS's Flow-Conditioned Parameter Grid software](https://www.usgs.gov/software/flow-conditioned-parameter-grid-tools) implemented a `xarray` based workflow.
| [Xarray-DataAccessor] | author | @LimnoTech | Read-in gridded climate, topographic, land cover, and soils data into standardized `xarray.Dataset` objects. `Xarray-DataAccessor` includes a range of data transformations and utility functions that meet various hydrologic modeling requirements.
| [NO2-Modelling] | author | George Washington University | Scripts for urban NO2 air quality analysis. Funded by the Air, Climate, and Health Lab at George Washington University.
| [GCS-Analysis-Tools] | author | UC Davis |  A Graphic User Interface (GUI) enabling a complete Geomorphic Covariance Structure analysis (GCS). This project was a deliverable from time working as a graduate reasearch assistant for the [Pasternack Lab @ UC Davis](http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research).
